            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This poor woman came to the Court upon the 17. day of laſt <hi>April,</hi> and thought immediately to have ſpoken with his Highneſs the Lord Protector, and to return again the ſame day: but alas ſhe found it other ways. And ſome of the Gaurd about the Court told her, if ſhe had but five pounds to give them, they would help her to the preſence of the Lord Protector. Whereupon, after two days waiting in vain at Court, being much troubled that ſhe could not come before his Highneſs, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge her conſcience, ſhe came to the Citie of <hi>London,</hi>) and wandered up &amp; down to ſee if ſhe could get any body to take it from her mouth, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it in Print, that ſhe might get ſome eaſe that way: but of a long while, ſhe being a ſtranger, ſhe could get none to hear or regard her. At laſt ſhe met with ſome compaſſionate bodie that talked with her, and ſent her with a note to me, who took all
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119945:5"/>the Report from her mouth, as you have it above, and then ſent her away, promiſing to get it Printed, if ſhe could not get the Copie delivered to his Highneſs, which ſhe had to give him, and have ſeen her no more ſince.</p>
            <p>But hearing now that ſuch a like woman is about the Citie, and that ſhe is Dumb, &amp; that ſhe was in <hi>Fleet-street</hi> on Sunday <hi>June</hi> 18. where ſhe ſtood mute for a long while, and as it is ſaid, the cruel Bedles dragged her to Bridewel, and wounded the poor ſoul for nothing, but becauſe ſhe ſtood harmleſly in the ſtreet: and that they refuſed her at Bridewel, and turned her our again among the wanton mad crew, who flocked about her and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed her; when indeed, if there had been any charitie in them at Bridewel (as ſome pretend the houſe is for that uſe) there was for them a fair object to ſhew their charitie upon: but ſhe ſtayed thereabouts until night; &amp; what is become of her ſince, God
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119945:5"/>knows, we hear nothing more of her.</p>
            <p>Now this woman was very ſenſible &amp; profound in what ſhe ſpake to me, but as ſhe ſaid, when ſhe is Dumb, all her ſences are taken up, and then the matter which troubles her mind, is dictated and made plain to her by the Spirit of God; ſo that when ſhe comes to her ſelf, ſhe has it by heart. And though it be but ſhort, yet you ſhall find more truth and ſubſtance in it, than in all <hi>Hana Trampenels</hi> ſongs or ſayings, whom ſome account of as the <hi>Diana</hi> of the Engliſh, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.34. as may appear by this that was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for her.</p>

            <head>A WORD FROM GOD To the COMMONS of ENGLAND &amp; WALES.</head>
            <p>BEloved, ſince it pleaſed Almightie God, by the wiſdom of his Highneſs the Lord PROTECTOR and his Council, to put once more your Libertie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your own hands, for to chooſe a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Now it behoves you to be wiſe, and that you ſend not up Factious Men: for all the hopes of the former unſavourie Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is, that this next Parliament will be factious alſo; and will avenge them on his Highneſs and his Council, for their Diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119945:6"/>of them. Therefore chooſe you out in all Counties and Cities, Men that neither acted for King or Parliament, but ſtood Newters all this while; even ſuch wiſe, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Men are moſt ſit to be Umpiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Parties, and will do moſt good unto the Nation, for the ſettling of it in peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Therefore, all you that are for the Peace of our Jeruſalem, I know you are in number Ten to One, chooſe ſuch men, and ſend them up, and I am ſure God will give a bleſſing to it, and that it will be well reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Highneſs and his Council, and all wiſe men. I hope God hath reſerved a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient number throughout all the Counties and Cities of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> who are Men of qualitie that ſtood Neuters, by the providence of God, for this end: ſeek them out; &amp; if there be not enough of ſuch Men, ſend a Plow-man rather than any that have acted for King or Parliament. This is the way of peace: for to make peace, quit your ſelves like Men, be ſtrong, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.13.</p>
            <p>Truly, when this woman came to my houſe firſt, and began to ſpeak, I did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to hear ſuch ſolid things come from her; for I thought her to be the pooreſt ſenceleſs, harmleſs creature that ever I heard, and I was readie to turn her away: but
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119945:7"/>when ſhe came to ſhew how her ſpirit was troubled, and how, when, and what ſhe had received, and ſeeing her meekneſs, I ſaw then that ſhe was an Angel of God, and did what I could do for her. And now this poor woman ſtill having theſe things upon her ſpirit, I was troubled in mind to hear that ſhe is come up, and was in ſuch a condition. Therefore, hoping it will much apeace her mind, to ſee this Paper come forth in her name, it being her own work that ſhe will juſtifie. It was neceſſarie to comfort and reſtore her by putting it in Print, ſeeing there is nothing in it but good adviſe; and it may be more of God than we are aware of, and that by this Dumb woman, God will put all vain talkers to ſilence, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27, 28.</p>
            <p>I thought to had forth in Print afore now, a Vindication of his Highneſs the Lord Protector, from the groſs aſperſion caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. And the Viſions I had concerning on him. And the Viſions I had concerning his Justification.</p>
            <p>Alſo the Vindication of the Proteſtant Church, and of Propheſie. With the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of my ſelf, concerning two Sheets falſly Printed and put forth in my name. And to make out unto you, that 1653 is not compleat from the Birth of Chriſt, untill the 25. of next <hi>December.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:119945:7"/>
Thus the 25. of <hi>March</hi> is the day of Chriſts Conception, die Birth is 9. Months after the Conception, ſo that if it was laſt 25. of <hi>March</hi> 1653. compleat from the Conception of Chriſt, it cannot be 1653. compleat from the Birth, until the 25. of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> next.</p>
            <p>Again, by the Aſtrological, or Julian ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, which beginneth the firſt of <hi>January,</hi> take notice, that Chriſt was born <hi>December</hi> 25. it being within eight days to the end of the Julian year; and according to that, they wrote it his Second year when he was but eight days old. That within eight days after his firſt year was compleat, they wrote it his Third year; and ſo went on until now. And if you examin that account, you ſhall find by it alſo, That it is not 1653. compleat years, from the Birth of Chriſt until next <hi>Dec.</hi> 25. and by that time my words will be fulfilled.</p>
            <p>All theſe things you ſhould have had out at large before now, but that I could not get it Printed; the reaſon is, becauſe the Genious of this Nation now, is generally againſt his Highneſs the Lord Protector; ſo that any thing which ſpeaks well of him, is ſo ſlighted by them, that though it be never ſo clear a truth, they will not look upon it. And therefore the Book-ſellers will not meddle with it, becauſe they cannot vend it: ſo that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119945:8"/>though my Book ſpeaks as much for King <hi>Charles</hi> as ever I did. And ſeek to bring an union between the King and his Highneſs for the good of the Kingdom. If they did but know what is good for them; yet they are bewitched with lies againſt his Highneſs, that they cannot reliſh the truth that is on his ſide. But if my Book come forth, I hope in God it will turn them to another tune. If not, I have loſt three Months labour, and my Reward is with God, who will clear the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent another way.</p>
            <p>Many think, becauſe I have always argued for his Highneſs, that I have received ſome; gratuitie from his Highneſs. Truly friends, he hath had of my Books; and though many times I have been at his houſe, and ſpoke with him, yet I never ate of his bread nor drunk of his drink, neither received ſo much as 2. ſhillings in money from him in all my life, God is witneſs. Therefore I ſay, as I do to <hi>Charles Steward,</hi> who for my love, when I was in the flower of my age, and moſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to do my ſelf good, kept me in priſon three years. So if his Highneſs were mine enemie I muſt do him right; looking nothing upon theſe outward things, elſe I am not the ſervant of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>John Rogers</hi> and others, would have his Highneſs to ſtand to rite Vow made on
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:119945:8"/>
               <hi>Triplow-heath,</hi> that is. To throw down the Miniſters: but I would have him to Keep his Firſt Vow, and to do his firſt work as the Spirit of God directeth him, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.4, 5. And that is to ſtand for the Proteſtant Church &amp; King <hi>Charles:</hi> for <hi>Triplow-heath</hi> ſignifies, that they ſhall trip low indeed, even ſo low as hell that keep that wicked Vow: the name of the place is very ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, and it was ſo named by reaſon our wiſe Predeceſſors foreſaw the wicked Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination that was made upon it. Therefore it is good for his Highneſs to take the ſureſt way, and keep his firſt vow; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he by it he forced to break his later Vow.</p>
            <p>And let the Miniſters Faſt and Pray, that their Adverſaries prevail not. When I talk with the Independants and Anabaptiſts, and ask them why would they deſtroy the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; becauſe, ſay they, they are Drunkards, Swearers, Whore-maſters, &amp; that they are Covetous, and do not preach Chriſt, but themſelves for their own ends. I could wiſh they had no juſt cauſe to ſay it; for you Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are the Salt of the Earth, but if the ſalt have loſt his favour, wherewith ſhall it be ſalted? it is, thenceforth good for nothing but to be caſt out, &amp; to be troden under foot of men, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.49, 50. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14, 34, 35. Gods Judgement is juſt, you have been
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119945:9"/>ſufficiently trodden under foot alreadie, If you had not been unſavourie, ſuch things had not come to you. And now, leſt it be worſe with you yet, amend your lives, for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.17. Who knows the fruit of the next Aſſembly that is to meet <hi>Sept.</hi> 3. it is time to pray now.</p>
            <p>But me thinks I hear ſome ſay, Which way will the Lord Protector ever come ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to do any thing for the King?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, The ways of God are paſt find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33. Yet this is like to be the way, There is a Parliament (if not prevented by a North wind) to begin <hi>Sept.</hi> 3. next. The Independant &amp; Anabaptiſt do ſtrive to have ſuch Men choſen as will be for them. And do ſtrive all this time to make the Armie to be on their ſide; and this is like to take effect, if not diverted in the Election, as above ſaid. That when the Parliam. ſits, they having the major part of the Armie for their ſide, they will immediately disable his Highneſs. Then ſpeedily he muſt Declare for the King. And upon that account the whole Kingdom will ſtand up with him as one Man, and proſper. Thus much I ſpeak from a ground of reaſon, and I think I have the Spirit of God in it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.40.</p>
